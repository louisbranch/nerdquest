# NerdQuest

NerQuest is a game highly inspired on the classic "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?". The idea is very simple, the player must follow clues and travel across many cities and, in the end, try to capture a criminal. Having this concept in mind, we made a few twists:

* First, all the locations are from fictional universes, ranging from Lord of the Rings to Shadowrun
* Second, there is no criminal. At the end you must guess, using clues from Facebook, which friend of yours is the culprit.

## Stack
* Node.js
* CouchDB
* Express.js
* Backbone.js
* Socket.io
* ???
* Profit!
